# Aurora Game Engine

This is a small passion project that isn't intended to be ground breaking in any way. I am still learning better programming practices and have only been seriously using C/C++ for about a year now, any bugs and issues with this software are par for the course considering that it was written by a 16 year old...

This software was written using NeoVim with many customizations to make it adequate for C/C++ programming. Any formatting issues are the result of Vim.

<!-- I am aware this table is a mess, just let it be for now, it isn't hurting anyone -->
